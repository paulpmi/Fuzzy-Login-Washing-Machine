Basic Fuzzy Logic program so that a washing machine uses power directly proportionate with how muny clothes are in and their texture.

The program contains three main classes Texture, Load and Cycle. Each are classified in different types depending on three graphs corresponding to each. To know how to classify each input we look in the graph and calculate the input in all the classifications using either the triangle or the trapeziod formula, depending on how they are represented. The Cycle gets input from Texture and Load and then gives the most probable way to go with it's washing.
